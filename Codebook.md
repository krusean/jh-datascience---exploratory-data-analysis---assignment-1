## Description of Measurements
 Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

## Information about Variables of data table "plot_data" created by the scripts plot1-4.R

1. **datetime**: Concatenation of the date and time variables in col 2 and 3
2. **date**: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
3. **time**: time in format hh:mm:ss
4. **global_active_power**: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
5. **global_reactive_power**: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
6. **voltage**: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
7. **global_intensity**:  household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
8. **sub_metering_1**: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
9. **sub_metering_2**: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
10. **sub_metering_3**: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
